                This extension has been an absolute lifesaver. I have that fantastic combo of ADHD and Dyslexia while trying to go through college. I have difficulty keeping letters in order, seeing the gaps between words, and with ADHD on top, I lose focus A LOT. 			The immersive reader has been my new best friend. It drowns out the rest of the content on the page, changes the font to something I can read, and highlights the word as it reads to me. My eyes are forced to keep going in the right direction. I can slow down and pay attention to what I'm reading. I don't even have to go back and read the same paragraph 5 times to understand it! The screen overlay has been outstanding for eye strain and being able to distinguish between words and spaces. The custom font and spacing for research articles have been an enormous advantage! I can actually read the research papers now and not have this daunting 2 column fine print page to squint over.All around, this has been the best purchase I've ever had. I use this every day, with every assignment. I don't even struggle with story-based questions anymore. The immersive reader helps me read, listen, and understand the question all at once. I am still exploring what I can use this with and how it can make my academic career, and I keep getting impressed with every new way I find to use it. Seriously, try it out. You won't regret it at all. Even if you don't have dyslexia or ADHD, just try it out. You might find that it helps you understand the content you're trying to learn even better!",

                Helperbird is an excellent extension supporting a range of learning differences. Aside from providing many evidence-based dyslexia-assistive tools, the extension also functions as an easy-to-use, feature-rich web experience customization tool suitable to support a wide range of cognitive differences (i.e., color blindness and ADHD-related focus concerns, among others). Also, the developer is a very good person who supports the various learning-different communities in many ways, including by designing the free version of Helperbird to provide enough functionality to be beneficial to people who cannot afford to subscribe to the full-function version.",

                This is my first google review ever! I have to share that the accessibility and support for independent access for students that Helperbird provides, is a game changer. It is constantly being updated with new features based on feedback and it is extremely user friendly. The ability to customize the settings allows students to have control over their own learning, aligning with Universal Design for Learning. Looking forward to sharing with students and fellow educators on a daily basis. Thanks, Helperbird team!",

                Let me tell you, I didn't know how badly I needed this until I got it. It was much like when I got glasses, I had just assumed that was how everyone saw the world...then it wasn't. Thank you Helperbird for the efforts you put forth in this lovely extension for everyone to use. The fact that you can use so much on the free just goes to show that this is something to help aid people not just some money grab. However with the pricing it still couldn't be a money grab. Thank you all again for the efforts you put forth so others can enjoy the internet more fully.",

                Immersive Reader from Microsoft is amazing, but my friends in Google districts were missing out until I found Helperbird. Great for proofreading! Simply highlight the text and have it read back to you, change the spacing in your view, highlight parts of speech, even translate by word or by document to have it read to you and adjust the speed! So amazing that I posted a YouTube tutorial within days of installing it. Plus, unlike many extensions, it didn't ask for obnoxious permissions like asking to delete everything in my Google Drive. #Winner #a11y",

                Helperbird is one of the most helpful tools I've ever used. It has so many great features that not many other apps or software have. The free version can be installed and stay forever on your browser. Other companies don't always give you access for free or give access for free forever. When you do get access to the Pro version or other paid plans, you expand your opportunity to read and stay focused better. One of the other great things about Helperbird is their support service. They have a video for every single feature that you can use. They are simple and helpful videos that make the learning process a lot easier. In addition, they have great live chat support. They are super nice and helpful. They always encourage people to give suggestions on how to improve Helperbird. Why is this important? It shows they really care about people with disabilities or people in general.",

                This chrome extension is absolutely amazing. I'm a Primary school teacher and it helps children with a broad range of needs. It's so easy to set up. I love the way it syncs across devices so set up is seamless across all the children's computers. The customizable features are a game changer for allowing children to enjoy reading and accessing the web in our school. The best application I have ever seen for school children.

                My son has dyslexia and has been struggling with parts of distant learning over the last year. We recently discovered this software and he is loving everything about it, especially with the ease of following directions and completing his assignments! We have used several other tools but this has everything a dyslexia person needs all in one bundle! The upgrade is defiantly worth it to make our daily struggles, on the computer, run much smoother. I also greatly appreciate customer support (helpdesk). They went above and beyond to make sure we were all set up on the computer for my son to most successful.",

                I have ADHD and yesterday Helperbird and the text-to-speech function (available in free version) turned a 28-page reading assignment from a two-day task to roughly two hours, maybe three at the absolute most. It helped tremendously! And I loved that the text-to-speech has such a fluid voice compared to a lot of others I've used! Honestly, the fact that this was created by someone who knows the struggles is something I love, because then it has neurodivergency in mind. I've tried too many things in the past that were created by neurotypical folk trying to be helpful to us and I do appreciate it, but it doesn't work as well because our brains work different.

font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Accessibility tips for Epilepsy</span></h1></div><div class="mt-6 text-lg max-w-prose mx-auto" id="blog-post"><p>One of those challenging disability conditions is epilepsy. Epilepsy is one of humanity's oldest recognized diseases, which affects roughly 50 million people worldwide (diagnosed in nearly 1 percent of the world's population). Each individual has his or her own story of what it is to live with epilepsy. Some are fortunate enough to only have the occasional seizure while others live under the constant threat of developing severe (status epilepticus) life-threatening seizures.<br>And despite increased research into the causes and treatments for epileptic seizures, many forms of epilepsy can't be cured. The varying levels of severity of the disease mean that different individuals will face very different challenges when accessing websites.</p><p>Online accessibility, on the other hand, is a concern for everyone but often doesn't get the attention it deserves. Even when designers are aware of their users' needs, they can have trouble implementing those needs into their work.</p><p>Here, we'll go over some tips and tricks for making your site or app more accessible to someone with epilepsy.</p><h2>Aesthetics</h2><p>Consider the following things when you're thinking about the aesthetics of your website or app:</p><ul><li><p>Make sure not to use too many colors or patterns. While having color in your design is important, remember that too much can be overwhelming for someone with epilepsy. Try to keep your color palette (and a number of colors) simple and consistent throughout the design.</p></li><li><p>Use complementary colors in your color palette to create a soothing, balanced look without being overpowering—like how blue and orange, if used consistently and carefully, can create a calming visual experience.</p></li></ul><h2>Labeling</h2><p>Make sure that all buttons are clearly labeled and that links are clearly formatted so they're easy to distinguish from regular text. This will not only make your site more accessible for people with vision problems, but also for people who rely on assistive technology like screen readers to navigate your site!</p><p>For instance, instead of &quot;click here,&quot; a link should say something like &quot;read our most recent blog post here.&quot;</p><h2>Contrast and color</h2><p>Lighting can have a huge effect on your ability to read something, whether you have epilepsy or not. It's important to make sure you have enough light to be able to see easily, but not too much. On top of that, you want to make sure there's a good amount of contrast between the background color and the text color. For example, if your background is white, the text should be black. If the background is black, the text should be white. This is because it takes longer for our eyes to process colors when they're similar, so it's easier for us to see when they're very different from each other.</p><h2>Readability</h2><p>When it comes to readability, epilepsy has some unique challenges. Some people with epilepsy can't read in patterns or on a white background, for example. Others have trouble reading when the text is too close together. It's important to find out what your friend needs. They might be able to tell you what colors and fonts are easiest for them to read. Additionally, you can make sure that you don't write more than one idea into a single sentence. This way your sentences are easier to parse. Finally, try using bullets or numbered lists whenever possible so that your content isn't overcrowded.</p><h2>Navigation</h2><p>Another important consideration for people with epilepsy is navigation. The most important thing you can do here is to keep your layout consistent from page to page so that it's easy for readers to understand how to navigate your site. You should also use clear headings and subheadings so that readers can scan through the piece quickly if they want to find something specific. Finally, make sure that links are easy to identify by using colors that stand out from other elements on the page (e.g., red text surrounded by blue background).</p><h2>Movement, Flash, and Animation</h2><p>While having a little bit of movement on your site can communicate information to the user—like highlighting a button that you want them to click—too much can cause seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy (A type of epilepsy in which flickering or flashing light (natural or artificial), overexposure to video games, high contrast patterns like stripes or checks that can trigger seizures).</p><p>Using blinking or flashing elements is another no-no for the same reason, so make sure that nothing on your site blinks more than three times per second! Also, if your site uses moving content that isn't essential to the user experience, make sure you offer a way for users to turn it off.</p><h2>Status Messages</h2><p>And finally, status messages or “toast messages” shouldn't flash more than once per second. This can also cause seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. They pop up and then fade away after a little bit of time. You should include options for people with epilepsy to disable them!</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>We've tried to lay out everything you can do to make your site accessible for people with epilepsy—no matter the level of complexity. Ultimately, accessibility isn't something that you can &quot;set and forget,&quot; but it's an ongoing process that needs your attention and consideration. You never know how much difference your small efforts could make to someone else's enjoyment of the web.</p><p>There are a lot of myths and misconceptions surrounding epilepsy, and even more when it comes to living with the condition. It's easy to fall into base assumptions about what an epilepsy sufferer can do, or can't do. But if we take a minute to see things from their perspective, we may be surprised at how much there is to gain for us all.</p><p>One last thing. Here at Helperbird, we dedicate our time to making your browsing experience as smooth as possible. If you find that some of the web features are a bit too stimulating, our “Hide Image” feature tool helps remove potentially harmful and distracting photos, gifs, and flashing images from web pages. It is a tool designed for Epileptic and highly sensitive users when using the web.</p></div></div></main><footer class="bg-white" aria-labelledby="footer-heading" style="background-color: rgb(246,
