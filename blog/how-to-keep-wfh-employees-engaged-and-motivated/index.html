I have that fantastic combo of ADHD and Dyslexia while trying to go through college. I have difficulty keeping letters in order, seeing the gaps between words, and with ADHD on top, I lose focus A LOT. 			The immersive reader has been my new best friend. It drowns out the rest of the content on the page, changes the font to something I can read, and highlights the word as it reads to me. My eyes are forced to keep going in the right direction. I can slow down and pay attention to what I'm reading. I don't even have to go back and read the same paragraph 5 times to understand it! The screen overlay has been outstanding for eye strain and being able to distinguish between words and spaces. The custom font and spacing for research articles have been an enormous advantage! I can actually read the research papers now and not have this daunting 2 column fine print page to squint over.All around, this has been the best purchase I've ever had. I use this every day, with every assignment. I don't even struggle with story-based questions anymore. The immersive reader helps me read, listen, and understand the question all at once. I am still exploring what I can use this with and how it can make my academic career, and I keep getting impressed with every new way I find to use it. Seriously, try it out. You won't regret it at all. Even if you don't have dyslexia or ADHD, just try it out. You might find that it helps you understand the content you're trying to learn even better!",

Aside from providing many evidence-based dyslexia-assistive tools, the extension also functions as an easy-to-use, feature-rich web experience customization tool suitable to support a wide range of cognitive differences (i.e., color blindness and ADHD-related focus concerns, among others). Also, the developer is a very good person who supports the various learning-different communities in many ways, including by designing the free version of Helperbird to provide enough functionality to be beneficial to people who cannot afford to subscribe to the full-function version.",

I have to share that the accessibility and support for independent access for students that Helperbird provides, is a game changer. It is constantly being updated with new features based on feedback and it is extremely user friendly. The ability to customize the settings allows students to have control over their own learning, aligning with Universal Design for Learning. Looking forward to sharing with students and fellow educators on a daily basis. Thanks, Helperbird team!",

She loves helperbird, and she is now much happier about the idea of returning to school. I think this might be a game changer, as they do so much web based schoolwork and research.  She says they really understand people with dyslexia",

Thank you Helperbird for the efforts you put forth in this lovely extension for everyone to use. The fact that you can use so much on the free just goes to show that this is something to help aid people not just some money grab. However with the pricing it still couldn't be a money grab. Thank you all again for the efforts you put forth so others can enjoy the internet more fully.",

Suffering with post concussion syndrome symptoms and working remotely is really hard! This extension basically saved my job. It gave me back productivity and the ability to read the screen. This extension has so many neat features I never even knew I needed. I love this and you will too! You don't need to be dyslexic or have dyslexia for this extension to benefit you. Do yourself a giant favor and get it! I highly recommend it!",

Great for proofreading! Simply highlight the text and have it read back to you, change the spacing in your view, highlight parts of speech, even translate by word or by document to have it read to you and adjust the speed! So amazing that I posted a YouTube tutorial within days of installing it. Plus, unlike many extensions, it didn't ask for obnoxious permissions like asking to delete everything in my Google Drive. #Winner #a11y",

It has so many great features that not many other apps or software have. The free version can be installed and stay forever on your browser. Other companies don't always give you access for free or give access for free forever. When you do get access to the Pro version or other paid plans, you expand your opportunity to read and stay focused better. One of the other great things about Helperbird is their support service. They have a video for every single feature that you can use. They are simple and helpful videos that make the learning process a lot easier. In addition, they have great live chat support. They are super nice and helpful. They always encourage people to give suggestions on how to improve Helperbird. Why is this important? It shows they really care about people with disabilities or people in general.",

We recently discovered this software and he is loving everything about it, especially with the ease of following directions and completing his assignments! We have used several other tools but this has everything a dyslexia person needs all in one bundle! The upgrade is defiantly worth it to make our daily struggles, on the computer, run much smoother. I also greatly appreciate customer support (helpdesk). They went above and beyond to make sure we were all set up on the computer for my son to most successful.",

It helped tremendously! And I loved that the text-to-speech has such a fluid voice compared to a lot of others I've used! Honestly, the fact that this was created by someone who knows the struggles is something I love, because then it has neurodivergency in mind. I've tried too many things in the past that were created by neurotypical folk trying to be helpful to us and I do appreciate it, but it doesn't work as well because our brains work different. Highly recommend!",

text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">How to Keep WFH Employees Engaged and Motivated</span></h1></div><div class="mt-6 text-lg max-w-prose mx-auto" id="blog-post"><p>These days, working remotely is no longer uncharted territory. That's why Upwork estimated that more than <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">26% of the American workforce</a> would work from home by 2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, adopting a work-from-home business model allows your company to reap these benefits:</p><p><strong>Save Thousands of Dollars</strong></p><p>According to <a href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics">Global Workplace Statistics</a> , employers can save $11,000 per employee annually. That's because you do not need to pay for office space.</p><p><strong>Save the Environment</strong></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency reveals that transportation accounts for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/carbon-pollution-transportation">28% of greenhouse gas emissions.</a> However, telecommuting means fewer cars on the road. And that could also mean you do not have to shell out transportation allowance to your employees.</p><h2>How to Keep Your Work-From-Home Employees Motivated</h2><p>Adopting a work-from-home model is more than just ensuring that your employees have set up their tech tools. They are susceptible to distractions, and staying indoors for too long can get boring.</p><p>Hence, you will need to look for a way to encourage their productivity.</p><p><strong>Provide the Right Tools</strong></p><p>There is more to remote working than having a laptop and stable internet.</p><p>As an employer, your responsibility is to provide the right tools to your employees. It can be a project management tool or plagiarism and grammar checker.</p><p>Doing so allows your employees to do their job correctly. As such, they become productive, which is beneficial for your business.</p><p>If you are wary about the expenses, remember that you do not have to get the most expensive <a href="https://www.helperbird.com/blog/stay-on-task-8-productivity-tips-to-help-you-stay-focused-at-work">productivity tool</a>.</p><p>And you can start with a device that everyone in the company needs the most.</p><p><strong>Promote Inclusivity</strong></p><p>The great thing about letting employees work from home is that people with disabilities can now have employment opportunities. However, there is more to inclusivity than hiring differently-abled people.</p><p>That said, consider providing an <a href="https://www.helperbird.com">accessibility tool</a> for your employees with disabilities. Doing so can help them work and be productive despite their conditions.</p><h2>Recognize Your Employees</h2><p>Just because you do not see each other in person does not mean that there is no need to recognize your employees' efforts.</p><p>Keep in mind that they are the backbone of your business' success. So, it only makes sense to give credit where credit is due. And doing so will make your employees feel that they are part of a team that recognizes and rewards hard work.</p><p>Other than that, employees stay in a company, contribute more, and become more productive when recognized.</p><p>Whether you want to host a virtual awarding ceremony or share the news through group email, remember to give your employees a pat on the back.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/blog/how-to-keep-wfh-employees-engaged-and-motivated/how-to-keep-wfh-employees-engaged-and-motivated.jpg" alt="Photo of a dyslexic user"></p><h2>Have Fun Every Once in a While</h2><p>They say that &quot;all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&quot; As such, please schedule a game night once in a while.</p><p>Luckily, there are now various ways to schedule a virtual team-building event. You can choose to play online escape rooms or have a watch-and-learn event.</p><p>At Maid Sailors <a href="https://cleaningexec.com/">Maid Service NYC</a>, we often have a show-and-tell wherein we showcase different parts of our house. Often, we reward our employees with the cleanliest or most organized. This is something you can do with your employees as well.</p><p>Game nights are not just fun and allow your employees to have a break. It also allows you to know them better.</p><h2>Keep the Communication Lines Open</h2><p>Often, it is not the bells and whistles that we incorporate into the company that motivates our employees. Sometimes it is in the environment we build within our company.</p><p>That said, it is imperative to have an open line of communication with your employees.</p><p>It can be as simple as allowing your employees to send you a private message anytime. Another is to host regular town hall meetings and individual video calls via Skype, Zoom, or Google Meet.</p><p>After all, it is essential to have an ongoing communication thread when you do not get to meet your employees in person.</p><h2>Foster a Growth Mindset</h2><p>A growth mindset is realizing that there is more room for your employees to grow, regardless of where they are in their careers.</p><p>What you can do, as an employer, is to focus on your employees' capacity. This includes encouraging them to keep on learning and upgrade their skills.</p><p>Building a learning culture allows you to have innovative employees who are willing to take risks and accept failure. These are the characteristics you need to propel your business forward.</p><h2>Provide Regular Feedback</h2><p>We believe that the key to productivity is providing regular feedback. That's because it allows your employees to improve and do better.</p><p>Moreover, constructive feedback can be motivating. That's because it makes them feel involved in a company.</p><p>Feedback also ensures that you and your employees are on the same page. As a result, your employees can get things done correctly and more efficiently.</p><h2>Measure Your Employees' Motivation</h2><p>In case you do not know, there are various ways you can measure your employees' motivation.</p><p>You can create a questionnaire using online survey tools. Ask probing questions that can give you an insight into what is working well for your employees and what changes you need to implement.</p><p>There are also other indicators that you can monitor to know whether your employees' motivation is dwindling.</p><p>Number of absences. When more and more employees ask for a leave of absence, it indicates an ailing atmosphere in your company.</p><p>Shorter workdays. Are your employees logging in fewer hours or days as expected?</p><p>Lack of socialization. When your employees become detached, it can hurt other people's motivation and productivity.</p><p>Carelessness. Motivated people have keen attention to details, which is the opposite for those who are not.</p><p>When you see these signs, that means you need to take action.</p><h2>Conclusion: Remote Work is Here to Stay</h2><p>It is undeniable that remote working will only grow in popularity in the future. After all, people who work from home are more productive.</p><p>Meanwhile, adopting such a business model is also beneficial for your company. So, we will not be surprised that around 40 million Americans will work from home by 2025. That will be an 87% increase from 2019 before COVID-19 happened.</p><p>That said, there is no better time to incorporate remote employee wellbeing into your company but now.</p></div></div></main><footer class="bg-white" aria-labelledby="footer-heading" style="background-color: rgb(246, 245, 231);"><h2 id="footer-heading" class="sr-only">Footer</h2><div
